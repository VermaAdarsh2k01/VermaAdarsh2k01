# Hi, I’m Adarsh 👋  
**Full-Stack Developer | AI-Driven Product Builder | Ex-Founding Engineer @ Suprdash**

I build performance-first, scalable web applications with a strong focus on real-world product impact.  
My work sits at the intersection of **clean engineering, system design, and AI-powered features**.

I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, reliable systems and shipping products that actually get used.

## 🚀 What I Do

- Build full-stack products using **Next.js, React, and Node.js**
- Design **scalable APIs, databases, and caching layers**
- Integrate **LLM / AI APIs** with proper validation, rate-limiting, and cost control
- Optimise performance, UX, and developer experience
- Think in terms of **systems, not just screens**
